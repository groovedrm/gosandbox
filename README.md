### Tips For Managing Git Across Machines
* Variety of ways to do things. What I did was first created repo on Git
* Then cloned for initial dev to Windows box
* Subsequently tried to create a version of the repo mirroring the master on Mac
	* Trial/error, easiest route seemed to be to create empty repo on Mac
	* From there, perform a fetch on my Github repo and was able to sync
	* Changes to/from master should be accessible by simply fetching again
	* TRYING CHANGE 
	* So, then, when syncing back and forth, use git pull to sync down the master
